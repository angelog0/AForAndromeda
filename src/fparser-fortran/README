=======================

This directory contains the Fortran interface to the Function Parser
(FParser) library.

It is a C++ library which we have interfaced in Fortran taking
advantage of the new Fortran 2003+ Standard.

We started using function parsers since the end of the 1980s. Indeed
at that time, in university circles, there were circulating a parser
written in Pascal called FONCTION (or Fonction ptr?, we don't
remember...).

Successively, we rewrote it in C/C++ and used it exensively in many
programs.

A few years ago, we found FunctionParser
(http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser) and interfaced it. Since it
is written in C++, we needed to interface it first in C and then in
Fortran.

To test it, we wrote a simple test program, fparser_test.f90, which,
in the initial comment, explains as the parser is built.

fparser_dp.f90 and fparser_cd.f90 contain the modules which interface
real and complex functions. cwrapper_fparser.cc is the C interface to
the parser.

With these modules, we have also written several programs based on our
Fortran interface to BGI (http://winbgim.codecutter.org) and our
adaptation of Fortran-SDL2
(https://github.com/interkosmos/fortran-sdl2).
