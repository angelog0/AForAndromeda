=======================

This document contains a few examples of fortran programs "using" the
Function Parser (FParser) library.

It is a C++ library which we have interfaced in fortran exploiting the
new Fortran >= 2003 standards.

We started using function parser since the end of the 1980s. Indeed at
that time there was, on accademia environments, a parser written in
Pascal called FONCTION (or Fonction ptr?, we don't remember...).

Successively, we rewrote it in C/C++ and used it exensively in many
programs.

A few years ago, we found FunctionParser
(http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser) and interfaced it. Since it
is written in C++, we needed to interface it first in C an then in
fortran.

To test it, we wrote a simple test program, fparser_test.f90, which,
in the initial comment, explains as the parser is built.

fparser_dp.f90 and fparser_cd.f90 contain the modules which interface
real and complex functions. cwrapper_fparser.cc is the C interface to
the parser.

With these modules, we have also written some BGI applications (see
for example dynamics2d.f90, in the document about BGI-Fortran on this
site).
